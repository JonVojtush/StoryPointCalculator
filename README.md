## How to run
1. Download the latest "Story_Point_Calculator-release.zip" from the [release](https://github.com/JonVojtush/Story_Point_Calculator/releases "Latest Releases") page
2. Un-zip the folder
3. In the un-extracted folder, determine which executable to run for your operating system (Win, Mac, Linux)
4. Double click that program to run (resources.neu & WebView2Loader.dll must remain in that folder with the executable to run)
5. If a firewall app like Microsoft Defender pops up, allow the app to run
